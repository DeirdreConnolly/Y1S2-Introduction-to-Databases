-- REASONS FOR DESIGN --
/* Having constructed my initial desgin for the library database during last week's lab, I realised that I needed to make a few changes in order to create a more efficient database system. First of all, I solved the issue I was having with inputting an apostrophe into a field, such as in a book title. As single quotes are used in SQL to indicate a string, this caused an error. To bypass this, you simply need to double up on the single quote for it to register as an apostrophe.

Next in my changes, I noticed that I had the column Overdraft in the Members table, and OverdraftFee in the Loans table. I opted to drop the one in Members, changing the column in Loans to Overdraft. This reduces duplicates in the table. With this change, I set the datatype to deciaml in order to allow for currency.

All three of my tables have a primary key (Books = ISBN, Members = MemNo, Loans = RefNo).
I also made use of foreign keys, where possible, to connect my tables (Loans = MemNo, ISBN).

At first, I had the third table named Loan. I decided to change this to Loans, as it fits more. It also matches my other names, Books and Members, establishing a more collective theme. */
